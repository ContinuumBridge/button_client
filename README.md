# Button Client
A ContinuumBridge client for Button App (button_app)

This client has two parts:

* A web-app back-end that drives a user interface, which is largely used for configuration.
* A client body that communicates via the Bridge Controller with a bridge-app and, in response to this, sends emails, texts and posts data to an API.
